	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task. Efficient algorithms are those that complete their tasks in the shortest possible time for a given input size.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses. It is important to evaluate how much additional space an algorithm requires. For example, an algorithm using arrays to store data might have a space complexity of O(n).</p>
