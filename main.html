<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1> 
<p>Time complexity is an efficient measure of how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.</p>	
<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size, often expressed in Big O notation such as O(n).</p>
